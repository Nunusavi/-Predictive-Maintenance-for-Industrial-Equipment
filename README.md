**Project: Proactive Maintenance for Industrial Efficiency**

    - This project aims to develop a cutting-edge predictive maintenance model. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the model will analyze data from industrial equipment to forecast potential failures. This proactive approach will enable us to schedule maintenance interventions before breakdowns occur, maximizing equipment uptime and optimizing overall industrial efficiency.
